    a way to enable i/o for your node.js application
    
## hook.io is a distributed EventEmitter built on node.js. In addition to providing a minimalistic event framework, hook.io also provides a rich network of [hook libraries](https://github.com/hookio/hook.io/wiki/Hook.io-Libraries) for managing all sorts of input and output.

## "hooks" provide a very simple and light way to extend an application to seamlessly communicate with other "hook" enabled devices. By design, extending legacy applications to communicate with hook.io is *very* easy.

## hook.io applications are usually built by combining together several smaller "hooks" to compose new functionality in a distributed and organized way. 


## Features :

- Build large, decoupled, distributed, and fault tolerant I/O heavy applications in node.js
- Create hooks on ANY device that supports JavaScript (cross-browser support via [socket.io][1])
- Spawning and Daemonizing of processes handled with [Forever][4]
- Messaging API inherits and mimics Node's native EventEmitter API (with the help of EventEmitter2)
- Interprocess Message Publishing and Subscribing done through [EventEmitter2][2] and [dnode][3]
- Easily scale any tcp based messaging infrastructure (such as clustering socket.io chat rooms in memory) 
- Easily connect / disconnect hooks "hot" without affecting other services

# Installation

     [sudo] npm install hook.io -g
     
## Start a hook

    hookio
    
*auto-discovery will now create a hook server if this is your only running hook*

## Connect another hook

    hookio

*you now have two hooks connected to each other*

This is the most minimal hook.io application you can have. It does nothing. No cruft, no extra baggage.

## Connect another hook! With a REPL!

    hookio --repl

*you now have three hooks connected to each other*

## Extending your hook.io mesh

At this point, you've got 3 nodes talking to each other, and an interactive repl to run `hook.emit` and `hook.on` commands. Now you can extend your network of hooks using any of the existing hook libraries, or by extending from the base `Hook` object. You can now fire messages cross-process, cross-platform, and cross-browser.

# How about Unix Pipes?

## Pipe STDIN to hookio

    tail foo.txt -f | hookio 
    
**hook.io will now emit STDIN data as separate hook.io events**

    
## Pipe hook.io events to STDOUT

    hookio -p | less

Using the `-p` option, hook.io will stream events to STDOUT as `\n` delimited JSON documents. Each document represents a single hook.io event.

**example STDOUT:**

    {"name":"the-hook","event":"the-hook::sup","data":{"foo":"bar"}}

## Using hook.io programmatically

**Note:** This is only one, small, example.

*see [examples](https://github.com/hookio/hook.io/tree/master/examples) folder for extensive example code*

*to see all other supported types of hook messaging ( including EventEmitter and Callback style ), see: [https://github.com/hookio/hook.io/tree/master/examples/messaging](https://github.com/hookio/hook.io/tree/master/examples/messaging)*

```js
var Hook = require('hook.io').Hook;

var hookA = new Hook({
  name: "a"
});

hookA.on('*::sup', function(data){
  // outputs b::sup::dog
  console.log(this.event + ' ' + data);
});

// Hook.start defaults to localhost
// it can accept dnode constructor options ( for remote connections )
// these hooks can be started on diffirent machines / networks / devices
hookA.start();

var hookB = new Hook({
  name: "b"
});

hookB.on('hook::ready', function(){
  hookB.emit('sup', 'dog');
});

hookB.start();
```
 
## Tests

All tests are written with [vows](http:://vowsjs.org) and require that you link hook.io to itself:

``` bash
  $ cd /path/to/hook.io
  $ [sudo] npm link
  $ [sudo] npm link hook.io
  $ npm test
```
